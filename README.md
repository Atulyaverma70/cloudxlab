   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

2. Install the required packages:

## Database Setup

This project uses Docker for the database setup. Follow these steps to set up the MySQL database:

1. **Install Docker**  
   If Docker is not already installed on your system, download and install it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).

2. **Pull the MySQL Docker Image**  
   Run the following command to pull the MySQL image from Docker Hub:
   ```bash
   docker pull mysql
   ```

3. **Run the MySQL Container**  
   Start the MySQL container using the following command:
   ```bash
   docker run -d -p 3306:3306 --name mysql-container -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root mysql
   ```

---

## Migration and Configuration

After setting up the database, perform the following steps to configure and migrate the schema:

1. Generate the Prisma client:
   ```bash
   npx prisma generate
   ```

2. Apply database migrations:
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name initialize-schema
   ```

---

## Running the Backend

Once the database and migrations are set up, start the backend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

## Running the Project

1. Follow the instructions in [Frontend Setup](#frontend-setup) and [Backend Setup](#backend-setup).
2. Ensure the MySQL container is running before starting the backend:
   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```
3. Access the application through the frontend URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000`).
